  <h4>Feedback Linearizable Discretizations for Mechanical Systems with Retraction Maps</h4>
Mechanical systems, especially nonlinear systems have the dynamics (or spray) evolving on a manifold which has a particular mechanical structure. Feedback linearization is a technique to design feedback controllers for nonlinear systems, in such a way that the constructed feedback control allows for a locally linear system at every time instant. So, the question is now about how one can construct a feedback linearizable discretization which preserves the mechanical structure of the system.

  <h4>Nonlinear Infinite-Dimensional Modeling and Control of a Two DoF Flexible Wing</h4>
A flexible wing can be modeled in many different ways, and for different applications. The aeroelastic effects create many interesting phenomena, especially flutter, which must be considered in control design. If one assumes a high aspect-ratio wing, bending and twisting are the two relevant degrees of freedom which can be considered in the derivation of the dynamic equations in the form of partial differential equations.

<!--We analyzed the stability of a capsule in large-amplitude oscillatory extensional (LAOE) flow, as often used to study the rheology and dynamics of suspensions. Such a flow is typically established in a cross-slot configuration, with the particle (or particles) of interest observed in the stagnation region. However, controlling this configuration is challenging because the flow is unstable. We quantify such an instability for spherical elastic capsules suspended near the stagnation point using a non-modal global Floquet analysis, which is formulated to include full coupling of the capsule-viscous-flow dynamics. The flow is shown to be transiently, though not asymptotically, unstable. For each case considered, two predominant transient instabilities are identified: intra-period growth for translational capsule perturbations and period-to-period growth for certain capsule distortions. The amplitude of the intra-period instability depends linearly on the flow strength and oscillation period, and the period-to-period growth saturates over several periods, commensurate with the asymptotic stability of the flow.-->

  <h4>Design and Control of Flapping Wing Mechanism</h4>
Bio-mimickry in aerospace engineering has been the main motivation in the industry due to the natural efficiency found in avians, achieved over years of evolution. Our flapping wing mechanism is a design utilizing mechanically coupled feathering-flapping 2-DoF mechanism. The design is made such that the phase difference between flapping and feathering is 90 degrees and the aerodynamics is mathematically modeled to develop a controller.

  <h4>Safety-Critical Control for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</h4>
Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are a booming technology in the industry today. A highly ambitious application would be to design controllers for usage of a UAV in a Mars-like environment. Designing controllers for a system like a quadcopter, involves many state and control constraints. Popular techniques include Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC). One could try to implement MRAC with state and control constraints. For real-world applications, some safety bounds must be considered, which can be done using barrier Lyapunov functions (BLFs). Thus, we are interested in <i>safety-critical</i> control applied to a UAV in Mars-like environment, and validate this in Gazebo-Simulink simulations.

  <h4>Deformed and diseased cells</h4>
A train of red blood cells flowing in a round tube will either advect steadily or break down into a complex and irregular flow, depending upon its degree of confinement. We analyze this apparent instability, including full coupling between the viscous fluid flow and the elastic cell membranes. A linear stability analysis is constructed via a complete set of orthogonal perturbations to a boundary integral formulation of the flow equations. Both transiently and asymptotically amplifying disturbances are identified. Those that amplify transiently have short-wavelength shape distortions that carry significant membrane strain energy. In contrast, asymptotic disturbances are primarily rigid-body-like tilts and translations. It is shown that an intermediate cell-cell spacing of about half a tube diameter suppresses long-time train instability, particularly when the vessel diameter is relatively small. Altering the viscosity ratio between the cytosol fluid within the cell and the suspending fluid is found to be asymptotically destabilizing for both higher and lower viscosity ratios. Altering the cytosol volume away from that of a nominally healthy discocyte alters the stability with complex dependence on train density and vessel diameter. Several of the observations are consistent with a switch from predominantly cell-cell interactions for dense trains and predominantly cell-wall interactions for less dense trains. Direct numerical simulations are used to verify the linear stability analysis and track the perturbation growth into a self-sustaining disordered regime.
