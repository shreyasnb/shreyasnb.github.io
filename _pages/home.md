# Welcome!

Hi, I'm Shreyas. I am currently an undergraduate at the <a href="https://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/home/">Department of Aerospace Engineering</a>,Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. I'm also pursuing my masters through the IDDDP Programme in <a href="https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/">Systems and Controls Engineering</a>.


### Geometric mechanics and control

Mechanical systems, especially nonlinear systems have the dynamics (or spray) evolving on a manifold which has a particular mechanical structure. Feedback linearization is a technique to design feedback controllers for nonlinear systems, in such a way that the constructed feedback control allows for a locally linear system at every time instant. So, the question is now about how one can construct a feedback linearizable discretization which preserves the mechanical structure of the system.
