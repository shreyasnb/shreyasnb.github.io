# Welcome!

Hi, I'm Shreyas. I am currently an undergraduate at the <a href="https://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/home/">Department of Aerospace Engineering</a>, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. I'm also pursuing my masters through <a href="https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/idddpCourseWork.html">IDDDP</a> in the <a href="https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/">Department of Systems and Controls Engineering</a>.

My research interests include geometric mechanics, differential geometry, geometric integrators, adaptive control, nonlinear dynamics and control, control theory, robotics and applied mathematics. I'm also a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the course <a href="https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/courses.html#639">SC 639</a>, running this semester.

## About me

I love math, and its applications in physical systems, especially in dynamics and geometry. While I like exploring niche topics in math, I also love playing various sports including football, cricket and volleyball. I'm from Bangalore, I love traveling, and I speak English, Hindi and a small amount of Spanish.

This website is my academic webpage containing my research background, and some content I've written on topics I find interesting. All my <a href="">blurbs</a> are written in LaTeX, and you can find the source code <a href="">here</a>.
