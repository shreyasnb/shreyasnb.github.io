# Welcome!

Hi, I'm Shreyas. I am currently an undergraduate at the <a href="https://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/home/">Department of Aerospace Engineering</a>, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. I'm also pursuing my masters through <a href="https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/idddpCourseWork.html">IDDDP</a> in the <a href="https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/">Department of Systems and Controls Engineering</a>.

My research interests include geometric mechanics, differential geometry, geometric integrators, adaptive control, nonlinear dynamics and control, control theory, robotics and applied mathematics. I'm also a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the course <a href="https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/courses.html#639">SC 639</a>, running this semester.

## My Research Interests

### Geometric mechanics and Control

My recent work under Prof. Banavar and Prof. David centers around mechanical systems, especially nonlinear systems having the dynamics (or spray) evolving on a manifold which has a particular mechanical structure. Feedback linearization is a technique to design feedback controllers for nonlinear systems, in such a way that the constructed feedback control allows for a locally linear system at every time instant. So, my work is about how one can construct feedback linearizable discretizations which preserves the mechanical structure of the system.

### Nonlinear Dynamics and Control

I've worked in modeling and control of many nonlinear dynamical problems, such as flexible 2-DoF wings and flapping wing mechanisms. My work with Prof. Vivek and Prof. Aditya is majorly about the control-oriented modeling of a flexible wing with twisting and transverse bending. Our contribution was that we were able to predict flutter using an infinite-dimensional model along with unsteady aerodynamics, which can be used to apply control and suppress flutter.

On the other hand, biomimicry in aerospace engineering has been the main motivation in the industry due to the natural efficiency found in avians, achieved over years of evolution. My work with Prof. Srikant and Prof. Aditya on a flapping wing mechanism, is a design utilizing mechanically coupled feathering-flapping 2-DoF mechanism. The design is made such that the phase difference between flapping and feathering is $$90^{\circ}$$ and the aerodynamics is mathematically modeled to develop a controller.
